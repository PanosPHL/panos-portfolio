    Player Seeking Player is a full-stack application built in React / Redux, Flask, Python, and PostgreSQL that aims to ease the difficulty of networking with local musicians in the COVID-19 era. This project was built completely in Vanilla CSS to cultivate the skill of building a fluid UI from the ground up.
    It is a social media application which allows users to post recordings, search for other users by instrument and preferred styles, and create bands all in the interest of managing the networking and collaboration of local musicians. It is my hope that it will help hobbyist and professional musicians alike manage their musical endeavors.
